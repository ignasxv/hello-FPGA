# getting started with system verilog and gtkwave

## installation

`sudo pacman -S iverilog gtkwave`

## hello verilog

write a simple hello-world file as shown

```verilog
module hello ();
    initial
    $display("Hello, World!");
endmodule
```

## compiling

we are using the iverilog compiler
to compile use the following command
`iverilog hello.v`

after running the program succesfully a a.out file will be generated in the same directory .
We shall then use vvp to run our program
`vvp a.out`
your output should be something like
`Hello, World!`
